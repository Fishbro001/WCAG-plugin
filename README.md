# WP-Wcag-plugin
A plugin im working on for wordpress to help developers make their webpages more accessible


This plugin requires you to modify .ENV file because it is using AWS

What it does:

Modifies page's html from backend and front end to make it more WCAG friendly. 

Creates a new Wordpress theme based on existing, to insert widget area and modify the theme. 

Adds a new post type "Explanations" which could be used to have clickable explained words on the page. (If you are using Advanced Custom Fields plugin, synonyms can be supplied to have 1 explanations post for more than one word).

Adds accesibilty panel, which a user can use to modify the page to make it easier to access. 

Adds text reader, word explainer which works either by going through the accessibility panel widget, or by highlighting the text.
